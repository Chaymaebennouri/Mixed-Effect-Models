Mixed Effects Models in R

Objective

Apply your understanding of Mixed Effects Models by performing a comprehensive analysis on a real-world dataset using R.

Dataset:

Use the "sleepstudy" dataset that comes with R. This dataset contains reaction times of subjects in a sleep
study. The main variables are `Reaction` (reaction time) and `Days` (number of days of sleep deprivation).
The study is looking at the effects of sleep deprivation on psychomotor performance (Belenky et al., 2003).
Data from this study is included as the built-in dataset sleepstudy in the lme4 package for R (Bates et al.,
2015).
This data meets our definition of multilevel data due to repeated measurements on the same dependent
variable (mean RT) for the same participants over ten days.
The dataset contains eighteen participants from the three-hour sleep condition. Each day, over 10 days,
participants performed a ten-minute "psychomotor vigilance test" where they had to monitor a display and
press a button as quickly as possible each time a stimulus appeared. The dependent measure in the dataset
is the participant's average response time (RT) on the task for that day.

Tasks:

1. Data Exploration.
a. Load the "sleepstudy" dataset.
b. Explore the structure of the dataset.
c. Visualize the data using appropriate plots to understand the distribution and relationships.
2. Descriptive Statistics.
a. Compute and report summary statistics for the key variables.
b. Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, boxplots) to better understand the distribution of reaction times
over different days.
3. Fit an adequate Model(s).
4. Interpret the results.
6. Residual Analysis
Submission Guidelines:
1. Prepare an R Script/Markdown document that includes your code, visualizations, and interpretations.
2. Provide a brief summary of your findings and insights.
3. Submit the R Markdown document and the corresponding PDF output.
